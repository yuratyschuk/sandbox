    <h2> The Composite View Pattern</h2>
    <p>
        All websites have something in common: they are made of pages that share similar structures. The pages share the
        same layout, while each page is made of different independent pieces, but always placed in the same position
        across
        all the site.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Composite View pattern formalizes this typical use, by allowing to create pages that have a similar
        structure,
        in which each section of the page vary in different situations.
